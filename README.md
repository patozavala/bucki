SpectralBuckets is a Spectral Information System (SIS) designed to hold spectral campaign data obtained by spectral devices, such as multispectral imaging systems mounted over drones [https://www.dji.com/p4-multispectral]. The inclusion of rich metadata ensures the durability of spectral data, enables the sharing of spectral data between research groups, and makes it possible to implement several ai-based solutions for the real world.
