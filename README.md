# Bucki


## The idea
Bucki is an API Rest that allows you to record and access data taken in the field. Each campaign is stored into a "bucki," the basic unit for data and metadata storage. You can control the persons who can access your buckis.

# Bucki SIS
BuckiSIS is the spectral layer of this project. BuckiSIS acts as a Spectral Information System (SIS) designed to hold spectral campaign data obtained by spectral devices, such as multispectral imaging systems mounted over drones. The inclusion of rich metadata ensures the durability of spectral data, enables the sharing of spectral data between research groups, and makes it possible to implement several ai-based solutions for the real world.
